## My process

I started by breaking down the project into components, then giving each one a class or an id with HTML. Then I moved on the CSS, styling each class from the top to the bottom. There were a few times I had to go back to an element at the top to modify something, but generally, I followed the top-to-bottom process. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

A new thing I learned with this challenge was how to add images to a page using CSS. I thought that could only be done with HTML, but I realized it could also be done with CSS and used for flexible purposes.
